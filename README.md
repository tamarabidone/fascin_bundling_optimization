This model was created using MATLAB 2022b.

The main file to run is FindOptimalAlphas_ForFilamentStructure_02.m. There are two models to run: Optimizing a pair of filaments (lines 92-94) or Adding one filament at a time (lines 101-105). Uncomment the model you wish to run. Also, there are three Filament arrangement options (line 35-58). Uncomment the arrangment that is allowed for the model you want to run (lines 91 & 99).
